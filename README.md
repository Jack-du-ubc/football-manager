# football-manager
Java CPSC210 course project that focuses on football team management

This project is an application of a **football team management** which includes management operations, (may have more features in fields like transfers, finance, match schedules in the future).
The project helps the manager of a football team to record the data and have a clear view of the status of the team.

I am doing this project because of my interest in football and football games. I love to play football with my friends despite being shortsighted and watch professional games in Europe. I did an incomplete version in the course project, and there are places to improve, to continue by debugging and adding more functionalities.
